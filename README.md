An online auction platform, BidMaster, is required to connect buyers and sellers in a digital marketplace where users can bid on a wide variety of items, from collectibles to electronics. 
The system must enable sellers to list items for auction, providing details such as item description, starting bid price, bidding deadline, and any reserve price. 
Buyers can browse active auctions, view item details, and place bids, with the system notifying them in real-time if they have been outbid.

The system should enforce bidding rules, ensuring that bids meet or exceed the current highest bid and that no bids are accepted after the auction closes. 
Buyers and sellers need secure accounts with bidding history. 
After an auction ends, the highest bidder should be notified and required to complete payment. If payment is successful, the seller receives shipping details to fulfill the order.


In addition, administrator will monitor auctions, manage user accounts, handle disputes, and generate reports on bidding activity and revenue.
